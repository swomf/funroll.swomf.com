        <p>Welcome to my Gentoo website.</p>
        <p>I love Gentoo. I also hate it.
          <br />
          Thus, your narrator is trustworthy.</p>
        <p>After convincing yourself of my site's
          <em>raison d'etre</em>
          below, maybe
          <a href="/conf">my exact configs and the journey to get there ⟹</a>
          will interest you.</p>
        <p class="m-0">Now, a thought experiment:</p>
      </div>
      <div id="top-hero-divider"></div>
      <div id="top-hero-right">
        <img src="butterfly.svg" alt="A Gentoo butterfly" id="top-hero-gentoo-butterfly">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p><span class="purple">Imagine</span> you keep stubbing your foot on AI-enabled Windows Explorer,
      or the Documents/ folder that is actually OneDrive, or the
      magic nonsense you fired into the Windows Registry.
      How <em class="grey">86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2</em>-esque.</p>
    <p><span class="purple">Imagine</span> you use Linux instead.
      <em>Yay!</em>
      Satisfaction with a system that actually likes you. Except
      you sometimes still stub your toe on peculiar design decisions. You fix it
      but forget it later on. Are your toes safe?</p>
    <p><span class="purple">Imagine</span> you then jump to Arch Linux.
      Less things to stub your toe here.
      After some literacy and time, you set it up once, and
      <em>boom,</em> rewards: 
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A lord-tier wiki where you're the first-class citizen</li>
      <li>Download-and-install packages that are mere text files</li>
      <li>Oops! Selective updates and downgrades are unsupported.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you have a life, you set up pre-update backups or jump to Fedora. Probably.
    Unless you get dangerous ideas about how the system should work.
    That the package manager should track what you season its packages with.</p>
    <p><span class="purple">Imagine</span> you go nuts and pick the guarantees of NixOS
      or the assisted-Linux-from-source of Gentoo. Or maybe BSD.</p>
    <p>The source code
    has never been easier to slap a hot rod engine onto. Now the
    easy stuff is harder, the hard stuff is easier,
      and the impossible stuff is only hard.
      Ground hurts your feet? Recompile it.</p>
    <p class="m-0"><span class="purple">Imagine</span>
      in particular: you follow me into Gentoo-land. Now we can</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Change install-time supports by
        <em class="blue">USE</em> flags
        in <em class="blue">package.use</em></li>
      <li>Change install-time environment variables by
        <em class="blue">package.env</em></li>
      <li>Choose between stable, unstable, and bleeding-edge by
        <em class="blue">package.ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</em></li>
      <li>Handmake patches/use others' patches via <em class="blue">patches</em></li>
      <li>Add little changes to install recipes via <em class="blue">install hooks</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em class="red">Caveat.</em> Those are all in different directories.
      What if, for some grand plan, you change three things about one package and also change
      one thing about three packages? How do you remember to keep these changes synced?</p>
    <div id="it-would-be-nice">
      <p><em class="purple">It would be nice</em> if you had a bunch of Markdown files
        explaining the code blocks you added.</p>
      <p><em class="purple">It would be nicer</em> if you could automatically rip out the code blocks
      right into your system config files so that the documentation syncs with the state.</p>
      <p><em class="purple">It would be nicest</em> if this became a pretty website at the same time.</p></div>
    <p>Congratulations! We invented <em class="purple">funroll</em>.
      And as Donald Knuth envisioned, we have a
      <em class="blue">"literate programming" architecture</em>.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming" target="_blank">(Wikipedia ⇗)</a></p>
    <p>Now what? Maybe check out my <a href="/conf">configs ⟹</a>. They're
      sardonically categorized for your viewing pleasure.</p>
    <p>Or perhaps look at the
      <a href="https://github.com/swomf/funroll.swomf.com" target="_blank">GitHub source code ⇗</a>
      directly. My source code is quadruply nice since it's also minimal C.</p>
    <p>Or watch paint dry. But why would you want to do that?</p>
